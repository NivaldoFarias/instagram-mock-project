## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Using only HTML and CSS, this layout should replicate Instagram's as best as possible, introducing further user-friendly responsive to screen-size layout, as per what's been learned during class _(see Linkedin profile)_.  A few bonuses may be included, such as: comments; input buttons; video rendering; and hidden overflow formatting.

### Study Playlist

In this section I included all Youtube content I used or refered to while studying for this project. Keep in mind that most of these videos contain information that was not previously studied during class, which may affect some parts of the code that contain these _extras_.
